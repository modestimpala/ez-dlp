# Project Overview

This repository contains two key components to make life using yt-dlp easier.

## 1. [ezdlp](https://github.com/modestimpala/ez-dlp/tree/master/ezdlp)

`ezdlp` is a console application that facilitates downloading videos or playlists using `yt-dlp`, with support for single and bulk downloads. It allows users to specify various configurations like download format, output template, and more. For detailed usage and configuration instructions, refer to the ezdlp README.

## 2. [Playlister](https://github.com/modestimpala/ez-dlp/tree/master/Playlister)

This component is a .NET console application that leverages the YouTubeExplode library to search for and retrieve YouTube playlist URLs based on input search terms. It processes an input file containing search terms or phrases, appends a customizable search term (e.g., "OST music"), and outputs the URLs of the found playlists. For more information on how to use and configure this program, see the YouTube Explode-Based Program README.
